                    <p>Serbia, country in the west-central Balkans. For most of the 20th century, it was a part of Yugoslavia. The capital of Serbia is Belgrade (Beograd), a cosmopolitan city at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers; Stari Grad, Belgrade’s old town, is dominated by an ancient fortress called the Kalemegdan and includes well-preserved examples of medieval architecture and some of eastern Europe’s most-renowned restaurants. Serbia’s second city, Novi Sad, lies upstream on the Danube; a cultural and educational centre, it resembles the university towns of nearby Hungary in many respects.</p>

                    <p>Beginning in the 1920s, Serbia was an integral part of Yugoslavia (meaning “Land of the South Slavs”), which included the modern countries of Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, and Montenegro. Long ruled in turn by the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary, these component nations combined in 1918 to form an independent federation known as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. In 1929 that federation was formally constituted as Yugoslavia. Serbia was the dominant part in this multiethnic union, though after World War II the nonaligned communist government of Josip Broz Tito accorded some measure of autonomy to the constituent republics and attempted to balance contending interests by dividing national administrative responsibilities (e.g., for intelligence and defense) along ethnic lines </p>

So, my routine through the week is pretty the same I'm going to my University, after that I go to the gym and after that I have some free time to hang out with my family or friends... On the weekends, we usually go outside and ride bicycles, or we go to the cafe/restaurants or some picnic on the mountain etc. At night, we make home parties or we go to the club. </p>

                    <p>
                        Anastasija: Ok If you are interested in winter tourism you need to visit Kopaonik ski resort. Kopaonik is the best and the biggest ski resort in Serbia. When we are talking about cities... You need to visit Belgrade - the capital of Serbia, Novi Sad and Niš. These three cities are the three biggest cities in the country. In Belgrade, you need to visit Kalemegdan Fortress, Knez Mihailova Street (main Pedestrian Street). Hram Svetog Save (the biggest orthodox temple. In addition, you should visit Belgrade waterfront... However, it is still under construction.In Novi Sad you should visit city center and Petrovaradin Fortress... I have never been in Niš before, but people say that you should visit Ćele kula.
