                        Estonia, country in northeastern Europe, the northernmost of the three Baltic states. Estonia’s area includes some 1,500 islands and islets; the two largest of these islands, Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, are off mainland Estonia’s west coast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Estonia has been dominated by foreign powers through much of its history. In 1940 it was incorporated into the U.S.S.R. as one of its constituent republics. Estonia remained a Soviet republic until 1991, when, along with the other Baltic states, it declared its independence.

                    <p>The Soviet Union recognized independence for Estonia and the other Baltic states on September 6, 1991, and United Nations membership followed shortly thereafter. Estonia set about transforming its government into a parliamentary democracy and reorienting its economy toward market capitalism. It sought integration with greater Europe and in 2004 joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU). </p>
                    <p>
                        Estonian, the official language of the country, is a member of the Finno-Ugric branch of the Uralic language family. More than two-thirds of the populace speak Estonian as a first language; about an additional one-fourth speak Russian as their first language (mostly in the northeast), though few Estonians over age 60 or under age 20 speak the language.

                    <p><b>-Tell me about your everyday life in Estonia. How is the life in Estonia? What do people do there?</b></p>
                    <p>Karoliina: Estonians are the most optimistic nation in the European Union. Our basic education is in top three globally regarding to PISA results. We have very high school education and good universities. In addition, we have many exchange students, because the studying is mostly free everywhere. The younger population speaks fluent English in addition to their native Estonian. Parents in Estonia are been given 435 days of fully paid maternity leave and 140 days of pregnancy leave. Setting up a company, voting, signing documents and viewing a personal health record are among the many things Estonians can do online. We are very close to the nature and we love to spend time in the nature. </p>
